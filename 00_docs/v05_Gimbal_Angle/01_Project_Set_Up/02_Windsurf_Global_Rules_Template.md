### Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read** [[01_Planning]] at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check** [[02_Tasks]] before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `/01_agentic_planning/01_PLANNING.md`.
