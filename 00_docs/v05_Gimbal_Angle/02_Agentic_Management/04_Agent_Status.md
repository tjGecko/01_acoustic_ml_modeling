# Agent Status - 2025-05-29

## Recent Changes

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation
- Implemented robust error handling for source positioning in the simulation environment
- Added validation for source positions to ensure they stay within room boundaries
- Improved signal handling and sampling rate consistency checks
- Enhanced debugging output for better traceability

### 2. Code Improvements
- Added proper type hints and documentation
- Improved configuration management with better path handling
- Added data provenance tracking for generated datasets
- Implemented proper cleanup of simulation resources

### 3. Project Structure
- Organized output directories with timestamp-based naming
- Added proper metadata and provenance information
- Improved configuration file organization

## Current Focus
- Completing the synthetic data generation pipeline
- Validating the simulation environment with different configurations
- Ensuring data quality and consistency

## Next Steps
1. Test the data generation with various room configurations
2. Add support for multiple sound sources
3. Implement data validation and quality checks
4. Document the data generation process and API
