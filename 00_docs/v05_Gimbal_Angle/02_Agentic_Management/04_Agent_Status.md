## Recent Changes

### 1. Digital Twin Visualization
- Refactored the digital twin visualization to use a spherical quadrant instead of a hemisphere
- Added proper 3D visualization of azimuth and elevation angles
- Improved the visualization with better labels and legends
- Fixed issues with triangle visualization using Poly3DCollection

### 2. Code Organization
- Separated data models from visualization logic
- Improved type hints and documentation
- Added proper error handling

### 3. Configuration
- Updated configuration to support the new visualization
- Added proper YAML serialization for numpy arrays

## Current Focus
- Completing the digital twin visualization
- Ensuring proper integration with the microphone array model
- Preparing for synthetic data generation

## Next Steps
1. Test the visualization with different configurations
2. Integrate with the microphone array model
3. Add support for visualizing multiple sound sources
4. Document the visualization API
