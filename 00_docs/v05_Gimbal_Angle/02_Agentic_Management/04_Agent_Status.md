## Recent Changes

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Single Channel Analysis
- Created `t03_single_channel_inspection.py` for analyzing tensor data
- Implemented statistical analysis of the first channel from 16-channel audio data
- Generated box plot visualization with detailed statistics using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Added support for both 2D and 3D tensor formats
- Calculated key statistics: min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles

### 2. Data Visualization Enhancements
- Implemented clean, publication-quality visualizations
- Added jittered points to show data distribution
- Included comprehensive statistics overlay
- Saved visualizations in high-resolution PNG format

### 3. Project Maintenance
