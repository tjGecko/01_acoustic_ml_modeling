# Agent Status - 2025-05-31

## Recent Changes

### 1. Numpy File Processing Updates
- Fixed numpy file processing to handle (time_samples, channels) format
- Added automatic transposition to (channels, time_samples) for compatibility
- Implemented file size and shape validation
- Added detailed error reporting for malformed files
- Processed 348 input files, generating 9,396 segments (9,048 training, 348 test)

### 2. Synthetic Data Generation Enhancements
- Added support for processing multiple WAV files per angle configuration
- Implemented runtime measurement for performance monitoring
- Improved error handling and logging for WAV file processing
- Added time tracking for the data generation process

### 3. TDOA Visualization Tool
- Added interactive TDOA heatmap visualization
- Implemented pairwise time delay calculation between microphones
- Added time window slider for dynamic analysis
- Included interpretation guide and metadata in the visualization

## Current Focus
- Validating numpy file processing pipeline
