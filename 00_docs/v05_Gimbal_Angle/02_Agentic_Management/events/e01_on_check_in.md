## Check-in Tasks
- [x] Use Obsidian references to resolve file locations within this file
- [x] Update any of the [[01_Planning]] naming conventions
- [x] Write a summary of Cascade Chat History and changes to [[04_Agent_Status]]
- [x] Use pip freeze to overwrite requirements.txt
- [x] Use Git flow naming convention and commit all project files

## Summary of Changes
- Added min-max scaling to tensor segments in the data processing pipeline
- Implemented safety checks for constant segments during normalization
- Updated project dependencies in requirements.txt
- Added execution timing decorator to monitor processing performance
- Processed 348 input files, generating 9,396 segments (9,048 training, 348 test)
- Validated data distribution and statistics
- Updated project documentation and agent status

## Next Steps
1. Analyze impact of min-max scaling on model performance
2. Optimize data processing pipeline for larger datasets
3. Add comprehensive data validation checks
4. Document the complete data preprocessing workflow
5. Prepare for model training with normalized data
