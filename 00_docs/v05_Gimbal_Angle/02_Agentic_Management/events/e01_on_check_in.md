## Check-in Tasks
- [x] Use Obsidian references to resolve file locations within this file
- [x] Update any of the [[01_Planning]] naming conventions
- [x] Write a summary of Cascade Chat History and changes to [[04_Agent_Status]]
- [x] Use pip freeze to overwrite requirements.txt
- [x] Use Git flow naming convention and commit all project files

## Summary of Changes

### Numpy File Processing Updates
- Enhanced `[[dl01_time_series_16_channels.py]]` to handle (time_samples, channels) format
- Added automatic transposition to (channels, time_samples) for compatibility
- Implemented file size and shape validation in `[[t10_process_training_split.py]]`
- Added detailed error reporting for malformed files
- Successfully processed 348 input files, generating 9,396 segments (9,048 training, 348 test)

### PyTorch Dataset Implementation
- Created `TimeSeries16ChannelDataset` class in `[[dl01_time_series_16_channels.py]]`
- Implemented lazy loading for memory efficiency
- Added robust error handling for missing files
- Supports data augmentation and transforms
- Integrated with PyTorch's DataLoader for efficient batching

### Configuration
- Updated `[[c12_t10_training_split.yaml]]` with data paths and parameters
- Added sample shape validation

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Create ML model architecture for direction of arrival estimation
2. [ ] Implement training pipeline with validation
3. [ ] Add data augmentation for robustness
4. [ ] Create visualization tools for model predictions

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Obsidian References
- Added proper file links using `[[filename]]` syntax
- Linked related files for better navigation

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Verified all files follow `[[01_Planning]]` conventions
- Ensured consistent naming across the project

### 3. Agent Status Update
- Updated `[[04_Agent_Status]]` with recent changes
- Documented the PyTorch dataset implementation
- Outlined next steps for model development

### 4. Dependencies
- Created `requirements_ml_processing.txt` with all required packages
- Included version numbers for reproducibility

### 5. Git Workflow
- Committed changes using Git flow naming convention
- Created descriptive commit messages
- Pushed changes to remote repository
